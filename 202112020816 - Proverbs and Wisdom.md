## Start small, be patient, and persistent

> 'The man who removes a mountain begins by carrying away small stones’…Chinese Proverb

This reminds me of the quote:

> All run rates start at zero.

> We want to hit home runs, but the reality is that we need to start small and build up over time.  Big projects start simple and focused.  Plus think about the determination and patience embedded in that statement.
