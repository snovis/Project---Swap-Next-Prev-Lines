This note consolidates a bunch of research I started in 2020 about mature masculinity and being a man.  There are multiple texts that form the basis of this work, but the back bone of it is [[Robert Moore]] work on the [[Carl Jung]] archetypes of human personality.

## Overview
This document conslidates my research that was simply aimed at getting a clearer understanding of how I can best behave as a mature man.  The idea was to build a mental model for mature masculinity.  It can't all be bad.  Currently social media, and what Warran Farrel calls the dominent gender paradigm are not leading to healthier mature men.  

Given that gender itself appears to be under attack, people that point to biology and science are getting in some pretty hot water, it feels like it is getting harder and harder to find useful or practical information on being a healthy man.  There are days it feels like:

Men are the source of:
- all suffering
- all oppression
- all bias
- all discremination

And that the world would be better off without them.  Well, since that leaves me no where to go, I decided to look in a different direction.  Recently, I gained some insight into why there is this vacuum in a healthy male model from [[Sam Harris]] and his book [[library/The Moral Landscape]].  Basically Dr. Harris points to two factors.

1. Science is restricted to pointing out what is, not what aught.[^1]
2. Moral relativism disempowers academia from making any attempt at defining how people "should live"[^2]

This creates quite a conundrum.  I agree with Dr. Harris that while positive psychology is studying human emotions like "happiness", they stop short in prescribing any kind of code of ethics or moral behavior.  They simply report. "what seems to be working".  But that leaves _religion_ as the sole arbiter of moral values.  Except that science, and well educated critical thinkers are all too happy to point out the enumerable flaws in nearly all of the world's major religions.  The one exception seeming to be Buddhism, at least as far as I can tell.

[[Yuval Noah Harari]] did an excellent job of concisely stating the problem in his book [[library/Sapiens]] when he broke down many of the fundamental flaws of the worlds religions but spared a moment to admire Buddhism because it did not have a god at it's center.[^3]  The interesting thing is that there is this sort of binary thinking, if the argument for God is false then, none of the rest of the information is worth listening to.

To be fair, most religions, including my own, Christianity, don't help themselves very much by taking an overly dogmatic approach to the written doctrine.  I mean, can you use the word dogma in a context _other than religion_?  I get it.  Modern positive social psychology points out that humans do crave a need to be safe, and in this world of thoughts and ideas, **certainty** feels like safety.  So when you attack ideas, especially religious ones, people feel like they are being attacked _personally_.  Dogma, I do not believe is restricted to religion alone, but to our very human need to feel _certain_ about what we believe.

Hell, it appears we are wired to need to "believe what we believe".  Countless books (the most recent the comes to mind is [[library/Influence]]), which indicate that humans often deny or reject the very influences that shape their behavior, clinging to the idea that we are rationally in control of our behavior.  Forces like [[Embodied Cognition]], [[Similarity and Mimicing]], and countless other effects seem real for others, but not ourselves.  [[202203240720 - Confabulation|Confabulation]], or the lie told honestly - we really believe what we are saying, even thought it may not be true, is the norm rather than the exception.

And please don't think lesser of us for it.  Being human is hard.  Thinking is hard.  Human Beings, Homo Sapiens are a _miracle_, regardless of how you think we got here.  For the sake of argument, let's stick with science and evolution.  The behavior of every other animal on this planet near as we can tell is governed by genetics and instincts.  Homo Sapiens on the other hand were gifted with this one marvelous attribute.  The naked, squishy, (mostly) hairless ape has programmable behaviors. That's right, we can adapt _within our own lifetimes_.  No other animal can do this.  Their adaptations take generations at least, possibly thousands, or even millions of years to evolve.  No so with the human.  People can live in deserts, artic tundra, tropical islands, virtually anywhere and everywhere and we have.  Behavior modification is no small feat.

Is it any wonder then, that there might be some limitations or confusion about our behaviors?  What's more, how long did it take us to figure out how to best behave?

Human's have been watching each other for a _very_ long time.  I personally am a fan of [[Rob Bell]] and his view of Christianity in the [[library/Love Wins|book Love Wins]].  I am not here to tear down anyone's religion, but I do believe there are invaluable insights to be gained by studying the books, stories, songs, and poems that created our modern western culture.  At a minimum if you want to go about changing things, you might want to know where you are starting from.

I lay all this out, for two reasons.  First, because it's good for me to go back and review what I believe and why I believe it.  Secondly, it's a way of gathering my building bricks for my current "thought palace", the structure that shapes my current values and morals.

So I believe there are three systems to draw upon.

1. What science does in fact know about our behavior (Psychology)
2. What ancient wisdom and belief systems have to say about values.
3. What we know from the history about how men, and the lives of men have changed over the last 100 years

That third item is relatively new.  It is formed from a library of books, which include:
- [[library/King, Warrior, Magician, Lover]]
- [[library/Iron John]]
- [[library/Breaking the Male Code]]
- [[No More Mr. Nice Guy]]
- [[The Lord of Four Quadrants]]
- [[library/The Boy Crisis]]
- [[Saving Our Sons]]
- [[library/The Way of the Superior Man]]

So there are two parts to this philosophy.  

1. How men mature
2. Mature Masculinity Defined (what to aim for)

I'll go over each part next.
