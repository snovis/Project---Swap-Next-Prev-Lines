## Overview
I keep coming across a lot of ideas around this.  This big ideas are being integrated into more and more presentations.  Angela Duckworth and her book Grit buildson Carol Dweck's Mindset.  They both build on Flow.

## Feynman
The big idea is that our attitude matters much more than talent or natural ability.  If we believe we can make a difference we do.

If we believe our results are out of our control, we don't try.

Things like your height, or your eye color seem to be out of our control.  Things like our effort however do feel like they are in our control.

How intelligent are you? Can you control it?
How talented are you?  Can you control it?

If you can exercise some influence or control over it, then chances are this is something you can improve over time.  The key is that when we focus on things we can't measure, can't define, and we don't know how to control - it can rob us of the very abilities we need to grow as individuals and humans.

The goal is to be energized by challenge, not diminished by it.
